1. Topic: Basketball shot types and which shot types leads to the best winning basketball
2. Assign a specific part to each group mate to work on and divide it up evenly so no one has to take a larger toll than another.
3. Project roles:
4. Luka:
5. Nathan Czopp: 
6. Eric Grenadier: 
7. Sahat Khan: Visualizing the data: Shot Charts, Heat Maps, Time-Series of Shot Selection, Player vs. Team Shot Distribution Comparison, Defender Proximity Charts, Expected Shot Value vs. Actual Shot Value, etc
8. Kevin Pham: Writing the plan, pushing all the changes, making sure everything works well.
9. Third bullet point: Finish what's needed by the deadline (preferably the by the night before or earlier)
10. First group meeting: Weekend or Thursdays afternoon(?)
11. Saturday, April 05, 2025 (time TBD)



Part 3:
Pre-class Part:
1. Communication definitely works well in a group setting(only if the people in it are good at it). Communication and just pulling your own weight will pretty much be all we need in a group setting to work functionally.
2. Group mates just didn't do their own work that they needed to and never communicated. What we did to overcome this was to just do it ourselves. What we could do differently is hope our personnel can buy in to the project.


1. Form of communication: text, email, or in-person meetings
2. Meeting frequency: Probably once or twice a week depending on how much progress is made. I would say a max of two hours is good, and if you can't make a meeting then communicate that and the group can communicate what is needed to be done out of you.
3. As long as everyone is working on something, I'd say that is the same page. If you aren't working on anything at all though, I think communicating that we need something done will be our version of holding someone accountable.
4. Overall goals: We want to find how to gameplan based on statistics and statistics only. We want to find which shot in basketball leads to the most winning basketball based off of efficiency in each different shot types. We plan to incorporate multiple graphs and showing raw numbers to support our arguments.

Part 4:
1.  Sending reminders for group meetings: Kevin
2.  Someone to test project code and making sure it is working well: Luka
3.  Someone to help with presentation slides: All of us can partially chip in 

Short-term goals:
1.  Got the dataset
2.  Organizing the dataset
3.  Being able to meet next Saturday to get started on this
4.  Points per possesion, points per shot, effective FG%
5.  Linear regression model: Points per shot/PPP against win rate %
